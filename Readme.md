# Readme

This code runs an interactive 3D visualization of the positions of planets and trans-Neptunian objects in the solar system.  It should be run using processing (https://processing.org/).  Data comes from a combination of the Minor Planet Center (orbital elements for TNOs), Wikipedia (radii of TNOs), and http://www.met.rdg.ac.uk/~ross/Astronomy/Planets.html (planetary orbital elements).
